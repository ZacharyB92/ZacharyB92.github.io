        <h2>Randy and Sue</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Randy and Sue are getting married in the next two months and they need a place to stay the night 
                before with both of their families. They have to travel a couple hours to get to the temple from 
                their hometown and aren’t familiar with the area. They have heard of a trustworthy hotel called 
                The Temple Inn and Suites and know they are close to the temple, so they won’t have to deal with
                 any traffic in the unfamiliar city on their big day. They find The Temple Inn and Suites and are 
                 relived to know they will be right there on their wedding day.  
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Bob and Betty</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Bob and Betty are a senior couple looking to spend a couple weeks enjoying a temple that is too 
                far to drive to from their home. They aren’t sure of the areas in the city where the temple is 
                located and know that areas surrounding the temple are typically nicer than other parts of town. 
                They want to stay at The Temple Inn and Suites for two weeks know they will have a shuttle and a 
                nice place to stay while not doing temple work.
