            <li>John wants to take his kids to the park to play on the playground but is unsure whether the weather 
                is good enough to go. He pulls up the lawn chair weather site and see that it is good to go!
            </li> 
            <li>Jane wants to go in the back yard and sit in her lawn chair to get some sun. She has been inside 
                watching a movie all day and has no clue what its like outside. She pulls up the weather site and 
                breaks out her shades.
            </li> 
            <li>
                John and Jane want to call over some freinds in a couple days to play volleyball in their yard. 
                John and Jane don't know what the weather will be like. They pull up the site and pick a day 
                that would be good.
            </li>
            <li>
                John wants to invite the guys over for a BBQ. He checks the weather site and decides to 
                have the bros over.

            <li>
                Jane wants to invite her kid's friends over to play in the yard. She checks the site to
